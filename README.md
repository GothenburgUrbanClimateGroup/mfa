# Multifunctionality Potential and Cost Matrix

## 1. About

The Multifunctionality Potential and Cost Matrix is a **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** web application based on 
the scientific paper by **[Thorsson et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2025.106239)**.

The Multifunctional Potential and Cost Matrix provides an integrated assessment of the benefits and costs of urban blue-green 
infrastructure (BGI) elements. Firstly, the potential to provide three functions: urban stormwater management, heat stress reduction 
and recreation, is assessed based on scientific evidence. Secondly, the combined performance across these three functions, i.e. 
the **multifunctionality potential**, is related to costs of initial construction and long-term maintenance to support planning decisions.

The application was developed by Nils Wallenberg with contributions from Sofia Thorsson, Oskar Bäcklin, Fredrik Lindberg and Janina Konarska.

## 3. How to use the matrix

### Before you start:

- Select the area of interest where the assessment will be applied.
- Identify which functions are relevant and prioritize them based on site-specific needs and prerequisites. 

### Using the matrix:

#### Assign weights to the different (sub)functions:
- Weight 1: all (sub)functions are equally important,
- Weight 2, 3, …: a (sub) function is more important than others (2 = twice as important, 3 = three times as important etc.),
- Weight 0: a (sub)function is not relevant.

#### Analyze the results:
- Changing the weights will alter the multifunctionality potential and/or total cost.
- This will indicate which BGI elements are more or less favourable for your site-specific context.

#### Experiment:
- Try different weight combinations and identify the BGI elements best suited to your needs.
